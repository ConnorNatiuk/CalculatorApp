## CONNOR'S CALCULATOR v1

This is the first version of a calculator that I made using a tutorial that I found online. This got my started with Java, Javaswing, and the basic building blocks of making a good program.

# Changes in the future

I want to make anothergit  version of this calculator, similar logic, but in different classes to clean up readability and mutability.
